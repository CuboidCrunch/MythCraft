# MythCraft #

This is the new version of MythCraft.

First of all: Great news. I apparently updated all MythCraft code past it's initial crappy version, and I forgot about this. Therefore, the quality of the code is at (somewhat) recent levels. Some stuff is still weird though.

## Known Issues with legacy MythCraft ##

* The CommandExecutor code is broken
* Persistance code is wonky
* ConfigManager class is deprecated, doesn't use UUID's (saving system doesn't work as-is)
* The Util class is weird.
* The way status effects work is pretty weird.
* The MythCraftPlayer class has heaps of useless things.
